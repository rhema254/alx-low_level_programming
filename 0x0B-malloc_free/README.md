2. Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
3. Write a function that concatenates two strings.
4. Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
5. Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
6. Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program. (#Advanced)
