This task is all about Bit Manipulation in C. The Mandatory tasks are as follows: 

TASK 0: Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned bit.
TASK 1: Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
TASK 2: Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. 
TASK 3: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
TASK 4: Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
TASK 5: Write a function that sets the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
